This\n      external storage and management of data is what makes IoT attractive to\n      consumers: it makes devices such as security cameras essentially\n      plug-and-play, avoiding the need to set up a home server and wiring like\n      in standard systems. This convenience, though, comes at a cost: all this\n      data, personal or not, is being transmitted off-premise and is therefore\n      out of the control of the user.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography variant=\"h5\" component=\"h5\">\n      Why Do We Need IoT Security?\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography\n      variant=\"body1\"\n      component=\"body1\"\n      paragraph={true}\n      display=\"block\"\n    >\n      Unlike when signing up for a subscription on a website, IoT devices gather\n      personal information through sensors without active involvement from the\n      user. This is where informed consent comes into play. Informed consent has\n      mostly been a topic of discussion in the medical field but has recently\n      become more prominent when discussing technology and, more specifically,\n      data collection. Informed consent is like consent but adds one simple\n      rule, making it much more robust: the stakeholder (in this case, the user\n      of an IoT device) must know exactly what they are consenting to.

Applying the same logic to IoT devices is simple: the user must be\n      informed of exactly what is being collected and where it might go (e.g.\n      stored on servers or distributed to a 3rd party). Without this\n      information, the user may still be consenting to something but it may be\n      out of lack of knowledge; oftentimes, this would also lead to an unknown\n      breach in their privacy.\n    </Typography>\n\n    <Typography variant=\"h5\" component=\"h5\">\n      Big Data and Profiling\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography\n      variant=\"body1\"\n      component=\"body1\"\n      paragraph={true}\n      display=\"block\"\n    >\n      The Internet of Things and Big Data are closely intertwined, simply\n      because of the fact that IoT devices tend to feed companies’ data needs.\n      In essence, Big Data is the collection of data on a massive scale to allow\n      further investigation and analysis in the future.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography\n      variant=\"body1\"\n      component=\"body1\"\n      paragraph={true}\n      display=\"block\"\n    >\n      Many companies boast that they anonymize collected data and that it could\n      never be traced back to their original source. This “anonymous” data is\n      usually tied to some kind of random, internal identifier rather than by,\n      for example, the user’s name. While this does technically mean that each\n      data point cannot be linked to one specific person, when looking at a\n      large data set (which is usually what happens when dealing with Big Data),\n      it is often possible to know quite a lot about a person’s habits and\n      whereabouts.

This\n      information may seem innocuous; who cares if the manufacturer knows if I’m\n      making coffee, it’s just coffee! The problem here lies with the fact that\n      the manufacturer now knows what your coffee making and showering habits\n      are, and can draw conclusions if your habits suddenly change. For example,\n      let’s say the coffee maker ran twice rather than once one morning, and\n      that the shower reports more activity than usual. Did the user meet\n      someone the day before? What if this starts happening every few days? The\n      manufacturer now knows about the user’s habits and any personal\n      information that might be derived from cross referencing with other data\n      which can reveal intimate aspects of a person’s life; a breach of privacy.\n      [3]\n    </Typography>\n\n    <Typography variant=\"h5\" component=\"h5\">\n      Improving Consumer Privacy\n    </Typography>\n\n    <Typography\n      variant=\"body1\"\n      component=\"body1\"\n      paragraph={true}\n      display=\"block\"\n    >\n      Most of the Internet of Things is still unregulated. The European Union’s\n      General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), that went into effect in mid\n      2018, is a step in the right direction. Courts have also started to\n      recognize people’s right to digital privacy. However, these things alone\n      do not solve all the issues mentioned previously. Governments will need to\n      step up and introduce strong legislation to prevent companies from\n      reaching across ethical boundaries and endangering the privacy of\n      consumers. They need to recognize that IoT devices, whether we like it or\n      not, are here to stay, and create the perfect opportunity for\n      manufacturers to collect vast amounts of personal data to the detriment of\n      consumers and their privacy.
