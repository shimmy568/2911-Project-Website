With this\r\n        huge number of devices out there we need to be extremely careful that\r\n        all these devices are secure and safe for their users.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n\r\n      <Typography\r\n        variant=\"body1\"\r\n        component=\"body1\"\r\n        paragraph={true}\r\n        display=\"block\"\r\n      >\r\n        However currently this is unfortunately not the case, there are many IoT\r\n        devices out there that are exploitable and as a result put not only\r\n        people's privacy at risk but also their own safety. An example of this\r\n        can be seen with a recent security breach that the company Ring dealt\r\n        with where their smart security cameras were hacked on a large scale\r\n        [2]. Resulting in things like people harassing children in their own\r\n        bedrooms [2]. While this event is concerning and should definitely be\r\n        dealt with, what concerns me more is if attacks like this occurred and\r\n        the hacker didn’t make themselves known and remained undetected for\r\n        months or even years.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body1\" component=\"body1\">\r\n        Some of the other security issues that we have to deal with are as\r\n        follows:\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <Typography variant=\"body1\" component=\"body1\">\r\n            Hackers creating botnets for cryptocurrency mining, DDoS attacks,\r\n            and many more [1]\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <Typography variant=\"body1\" component=\"body1\">\r\n            Security issues with automated vehicles and self driving cars that\r\n            could result in severe loss of life [4]\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <Typography variant=\"body1\" component=\"body1\">\r\n            Hackers getting access to our personal data for the purpose of\r\n            identity theft or otherwise [1]\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h5\" component=\"h5\">\r\n        What Can We Do?\r\n      </Typography>\r\n\r\n      <Typography\r\n        variant=\"body1\"\r\n        component=\"body1\"\r\n        paragraph={true}\r\n        display=\"block\"\r\n      >\r\n        So clearly something needs to be done, the question is just what can we\r\n        do? The main consensus is that we need some sort of security standards\r\n        put in place for the IoT industry. This could be done through optional\r\n        certifications that companies choose to get, or it could be enforced at\r\n        a government level to maintain consistency.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n\r\n      <Typography\r\n        variant=\"body1\"\r\n        component=\"body1\"\r\n        paragraph={true}\r\n        display=\"block\"\r\n      >\r\n        However due to the fact that there are already security standards in\r\n        place [6] and the problem is still this widespread leads me to believe\r\n        that this needs to be enforced on a government level. This is already\r\n        being done in several cases. For example california has recently\r\n        implemented legislation that requires companies to equip devices “with a\r\n        reasonable security feature or features” [5]. However this wording is\r\n        extremely vague and unless properly enforced will do little to solve\r\n        this problem. Another example of government regulation would be NIST\r\n        (U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology) IoT security\r\n        publications, while this work doesn’t set hard rules for companies to\r\n        follow it does lay the groundwork for future legislation [5]. There has\r\n        also been work done in the UK [5] to help secure IoT devices.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h5\" component=\"h5\">\r\n        Conclusion\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <Typography\r\n        variant=\"body1\"\r\n        component=\"body1\"\r\n        paragraph={true}\r\n        display=\"block\"\r\n      >\r\n        So as I’ve demonstrated IoT security has never been more important and\r\n        is only going to grow more rapidly in the future. Because of this it is\r\n        essential that we lay the foundation for proper rules and regulations to\r\n        ensure the security of not only our personal lives but our country as a\r\n        whole. This can and is being done through private security certification\r\n        programs but to ensure that proper security measures are taken it’s also\r\n        important to enforce these regulations at the government level. We’ve\r\n        already done a lot of good work towards this end, but there is still\r\n        lots that needs to be done to ensure that our IoT devices are secured\r\n        properly.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h5\" component=\"h5\">\r\n        References\r\n      </Typography>\r\n\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <Typography variant=\"body1\" component=\"body1\">\r\n            [1](\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.peerbits.com/blog/biggest-iot-security-challenges.html\">\r\n              General concerns with IoT\r\n            </a>\r\n            ):\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <Typography variant=\"body1\" component=\"body1\">\r\n            [2](\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/12/she-installed-ring-camera-her-childrens-room-peace-mind-hacker-accessed-it-harassed-her-year-old-daughter/?arc404=true\">\r\n              Child bedroom hack\r\n            </a>\r\n            ):\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <Typography variant=\"body1\" component=\"body1\">\r\n            [3](\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/iot-devices-need-security-standards-built-in-ul-says/\">\r\n              IoT needs security standards\r\n            </a>\r\n            ):\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <Typography variant=\"body1\" component=\"body1\">\r\n            [4](\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/\">\r\n              Hackers kill jeep on highway\r\n            </a>\r\n            ):\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <Typography variant=\"body1\" component=\"body1\">\r\n            [5](\r\n            <a href=\"https://securityboulevard.com/2020/01/new-iot-security-regulations-what-you-need-to-know-2/\">\r\n              California & NSIT IoT security standards\r\n            </a>\r\n            ):\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <Typography variant=\"body1\" component=\"body1\">\r\n            [6](\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.icsalabs.com/technology-program/iot-testing\">\r\n              ICSA security certification information\r\n            </a>\r\n            ):\r\n          </Typography>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n\r\n      <PaddedDivider />\r\n    </BodyContainer>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default SecurityPage\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
