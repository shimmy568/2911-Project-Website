An example of this can be seen with a recent security breach that the company Ring dealt with where their smart security cameras were hacked on a large scale [2]. Resulting in things like people harassing children in their own bedrooms [2]. While this event is concerning and should definitely be dealt with, what concerns me more is if attacks like this occurred and the hacker didn’t make themselves known and remained undetected for months or even years."),n.a.createElement(d.a,{variant:"body1",component:"body1"},"Some of the other security issues that we have to deal with are as follows:"),n.a.createElement("ul",null,n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(d.a,{variant:"body1",component:"body1"},"Hackers creating botnets for cryptocurrency mining, DDoS attacks, and many more [1]")),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(d.a,{variant:"body1",component:"body1"},"Security issues with automated vehicles and self driving cars that could result in severe loss of life [4]")),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement(d.a,{variant:"body1",component:"body1"},"Hackers getting access to our personal data for the purpose of identity theft or otherwise [1]"))),n.a.createElement(d.a,{variant:"h5",component:"h5"},"What Can We Do?"),n.a.createElement(d.a,{variant:"body1",component:"body1",paragraph:!0,display:"block"},"So clearly something needs to be done, the question is just what can we do?

This is already being done in several cases. For example california has recently implemented legislation that requires companies to equip devices “with a reasonable security feature or features” [5]. However this wording is extremely vague and unless properly enforced will do little to solve this problem. Another example of government regulation would be NIST (U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology) IoT security publications, while this work doesn’t set hard rules for companies to follow it does lay the groundwork for future legislation [5].

Because of this it is essential that we lay the foundation for proper rules and regulations to ensure the security of not only our personal lives but our country as a whole. This can and is being done through private security certification programs but to ensure that proper security measures are taken it’s also important to enforce these regulations at the government level.
