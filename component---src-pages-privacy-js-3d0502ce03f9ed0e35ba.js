This information may seem innocuous; who cares if the manufacturer knows if I’m making coffee, it’s just coffee! The problem here lies with the fact that the manufacturer now knows what your coffee making and showering habits are, and can draw conclusions if your habits suddenly change. For example, let’s say the coffee maker ran twice rather than once one morning, and that the shower reports more activity than usual. Did the user meet someone the day before? What if this starts happening every few days? The manufacturer now knows about the user’s habits and any personal information that might be derived from cross referencing with other data which can reveal intimate aspects of a person’s life; a breach of privacy.

Courts have also started to recognize people’s right to digital privacy. However, these things alone do not solve all the issues mentioned previously. Governments will need to step up and introduce strong legislation to prevent companies from reaching across ethical boundaries and endangering the privacy of consumers. They need to recognize that IoT devices, whether we like it or not, are here to stay, and create the perfect opportunity for manufacturers to collect vast amounts of personal data to the detriment of consumers and their privacy.
