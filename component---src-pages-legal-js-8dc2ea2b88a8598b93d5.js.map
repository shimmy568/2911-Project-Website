Governments must take\r\n        the lead and require companies to support their products with software,\r\n        parts and documentation.

Voting\r\n        with your wallet and avoiding brands with nasty practices is a step in\r\n        the right direction and using your voice in public forums will put the\r\n        pressure on companies to re-align with our values. We value the a long\r\n        term functionality guarantee on the stuff we buy, we value the ability\r\n        to repair our own stuff, and we value the right to resell our stuff when\r\n        we are done with it.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <PaddedDivider />\r\n    </BodyContainer>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default LegalPage\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
